# What is IaC?

<div class="columns">
<div>
Infrastructure as code (IaC) is a way to manage and provision infrastructure resources using configuration files and automation tools. 
</div>

<div>
The goal of IaC is to make it easier to deploy and manage infrastructure in a repeatable, reliable way, and to reduce the risk of errors caused by manual configuration.
</div>
</div>

---

# Security Tooling

Running static analysis security testing (SAST) tools against infrastructure as code (IaC) is a way to ensure that the infrastructure being provisioned is secure and compliant with best practices. 

---

# Why run Security Tooling?

## <i class="fa-solid fa-lock"></i> To catch security issues early
## <i class="fa-regular fa-square-check"></i> To ensure compliance
## <i class="fa-solid fa-chart-line"></i> To improve the security of your infrastructure
## <i class="fa-regular fa-clock"></i> To save time and effort by shifting Left

---

# Security and Compliance

There have been multiple breaches and attacks due to misconfiguration.
Vulnerabilities can be a simple omitted property.

# OWASP

[A05:2021 â€“ Security Misconfiguration](https://owasp.org/Top10/A05_2021-Security_Misconfiguration/)

# Shift Left on Security
## Save time and money

We can't just do security in production after everything is built, we need to go into solutions with security baked in.

---

# Security Tooling - Terraform

Each of these tools does similar things and are SAST (Static Analysis Security Tooling).
With Terraform you can analyze in a few ways.

1) hcl files
1) hcl files after interpolation and parsing

---

# Rule customization

- ignoring rules
- overriding rules
- adding custom rules

---

# Security Tooling - OSS

<div class="columns">
<div>
There are many open-source tools as well as commercial solutions. We can integrate these tools in our local environments as well as our pipelines to secure things earlier.

# Workflow Options

- pre-commit hooks
- ide integration
- ci/cd integration
- DAST (environment scanning)

---

# Pre-Commit Hooks

run before code gets committed to a git repo.
You do it yourself or use the precommit framework.

---

# IDE Integration

- extensions for vscode

---

# Pipeline integration

lots of marketplace extensions
pr commenter

---

# Backend providers

- AzureRM
- docs

---

# Overriding backend provider configuration
- Check docs
- use environment vars 

<!-- show vars or link -->
